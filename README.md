> Note: pay serious attetion to the requirements section. if you don't have them, then don't bother installing.

* To generate a parent page with a toolbar use;
**command**: `ppt`
* To generate a child page use;
**command**: `cpt`
* to generate a child page with a table component use;
**command**: `cptt`

## Requirements

This code-snippet generator doesn't have any requirements to be used. however, to view the page in you broswer make sure your project **must** have the following:

* React package installed (any version)
* Breadcrumbs, Button, PageLoadAnimation, GridContainer, GridItem, and CustomToolbar components present.
